                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Understanding Your Speed Test Results</h3>
                <p>An internet speed test measures the performance of your internet connection. Hereâ€™s what the key metrics mean:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Download Speed:</strong> This is the rate at which data is transferred from the internet to your device. It's measured in megabits per second (Mbps) and is crucial for activities like streaming videos, downloading files, and loading websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upload Speed:</strong> This is the rate at which data is transferred from your device to the internet. A higher upload speed is important for video calls, sending large files, and online gaming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ping (Latency):</strong> This is the reaction time of your connection, measured in milliseconds (ms). It's the time it takes for a signal to travel from your device to a server and back. Lower ping is better, especially for real-time applications like online gaming and video conferencing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jitter:</strong> This measures the variation in your ping over time. High jitter can cause buffering in streams and lag spikes in games. A lower, more stable jitter is ideal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">What is a Good Internet Speed?</h3>
                <p>"Good" depends on your needs. Here are some general guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Basic Use (1-5 Mbps):</strong> Checking email and light web browsing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard Use (5-25 Mbps):</strong> HD video streaming, online learning, and video calls for one or two devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heavy Use (25-100 Mbps):</strong> 4K video streaming, online gaming, and multiple devices streaming simultaneously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power User (100+ Mbps):</strong> Large file downloads, multiple 4K streams, and a household with many connected smart devices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">How to Improve Your Internet Speed</h3>
                <p>If your results are lower than expected, here are a few simple steps you can take:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Restart Your Router:</strong> The classic "turn it off and on again" works wonders. Unplug your router for 30 seconds and plug it back in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Move Closer to Your Router:</strong> If you're on Wi-Fi, physical distance and obstacles like walls can weaken the signal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use a Wired Connection:</strong> An Ethernet cable provides a more stable and faster connection than Wi-Fi.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce Network Congestion:</strong> Disconnect devices that aren't in use, as they can consume bandwidth in the background.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact Your ISP:</strong> If your speed is consistently lower than what you're paying for, it might be time to contact your Internet Service Provider.</li>
                </ol>
